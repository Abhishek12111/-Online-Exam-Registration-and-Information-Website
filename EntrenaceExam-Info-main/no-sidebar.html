						Engineering is the application of science and maths to solve problems. While scientists and
						inventors come up with innovations, it is engineers who apply these discoveries to the real
						world.

						Engineering is part of STEM education, which aims to engage students with science, technology,
						engineering and mathematics yet, as a discipline, it has been practiced for thousands of years.

							<h3>What does an Engineer do?</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							Engineers are involved in the design, evaluation, development, testing, modification,
							inspection and maintaining of a wide range of products, structures and systems. This
							involves everything from the recommending of materials and processes, overseeing
							manufacturing and construction processes, and conducting failure analysis and investigation,
							to providing consultancy services and teaching engineering to students and trainees.
						</p>
						<header>
							<h3>
								Types
							</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							<b>1. Mechanical Engineering</b><br>
							Mechanical engineers are involved in the design, manufacture, inspection and maintenance of
							machinery, equipment and components such as vehicles, engines, aerospace products, weapon
							systems, robotics, turbines, construction and farm machinery, as well as a wide range of
							tools and devices. This type of engineering is also associated with the management of
							control systems and instruments for measuring the performance and status of machinery.
<br>
							<b>2. Electrical Engineering</b><br>
							Electrical engineers work on the design, testing, manufacture, construction, control,
							monitoring and inspection of electrical and electronic devices, components, machines and
							systems. These range in size from the smallest microchips to large transmission and power
							generation systems. This includes everything from broadcast engineering to electromagnetic
							devices, computer systems, telecommunications and more.
<br>
							<b>3. Civil Engineering</b><br>
							Civil engineers are involved in the design, construction, maintenance and inspection of
							large civil infrastructure projects, including roads, railways, bridges, tunnels and dams.
<br>
							Working on both public and private projects, civil engineers traditionally work in
							sub-disciplines such as environmental engineering, structural engineering or surveying.

							As mentioned above, civil engineering was originally created to differentiate it from
							military engineering.
<br>
							<b>4. Aerospace Engineering</b><br>
							As a specialised branch of mechanical and electrical engineering, aerospace engineering
							focuses on the design, manufacture and testing of aircraft and spacecraft, including all
							parts and components. Covering everything from vehicle aerodynamics and efficiencies to
							electrical control and navigation systems, much of the expertise is also used for other
							vehicles, such as cars.
<br>
							<b>5. Nuclear Engineering</b><br>
							Nuclear engineers work on the design, manufacture, construction, operation, and testing of
							the equipment, systems and processes for the production and control of nuclear power. From
							nuclear power plant reactors to particle accelerators, nuclear engineers also work on
							factors such as monitoring and the storage of nuclear waste in order to protect people from
							potentially harmful situations.
<br>
							<b>6. Biomedical Engineering</b><br>
							Biomedical engineers are concerned with the design of systems, equipment and devices for use
							in healthcare and medicine. By working with medical specialists such as doctors, therapists
							and researchers, biomedical engineers are able to meet the requirements of healthcare
							professionals.
<br>
							<b>7. Chemical Engineering</b><br>
							Chemical engineers use physics, chemistry, biology and engineering principles for the design
							of equipment, systems and processes for refining raw materials for mixing, compounding and
							processing chemicals for a variety of products. Carrying out processes on a commercial
							scale, chemical engineers are involved in processes ranging from petroleum refining to
							fermentation and the production of biomolecules.
<br>
							<b>8. Computer Engineering</b><br>
							Computer engineers design computer hardware, systems, networks and software. Computer
							engineering combines other disciplines, such as electrical engineering and computer science,
							as well as software engineering and design.
<br>
							<b>9. Industrial Engineering</b><br>
							Industrial engineers design and optimise facilities, equipment and systems for
							manufacturing, materials processing and other industrial applications.
<br>
							<b>10. Environmental Engineering</b><br>
							Environmental engineers are concerned with the prevention, removal and elimination of
							sources of pollution that affect the environment. Measuring pollution levels, determining
							sources of pollution and cleaning up polluted areas, these engineers need to work in
							compliance with government regulations.
<br>
							<b>11. Marine Engineering</b><br>
							Marine engineering is related to any engineering tasks on or near the oceans. This includes
							design and development for shipping, submarines, oil rigs, on-board, harbours, plants and
							more. This specialised area of engineering combines other types of engineering, including
							mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, civil engineering, and programming.

					<p>
						Medical field contains a broad range of academic education other than MBBS. It contains the
						certificate courses, medical diploma courses, bachelor degree courses, master degree courses and
						many short time knowledge booster courses for medical professionals. The candidates having PCB
						or PCMB group in their +2 can appear in NEET 2022 exam for admission to the top medical colleges
						of the country.



						Various institutions and university from abroad and in India are offering some of the medical
						courses by Online. IGNOU is one of the leading universities that provide the education in the
						medical field by online admission.

						For admission to bachelor degree, the students must have to prepare for medical entrance test
						after 12th standard. The students must have science with Biology in 12th standard.

						NEET is the only national level medical entrance test after 12th.

						It is an expanded field of educational study and there are so many courses including medical
						diploma courses, degree courses, certificate courses and lab technical courses & other medical
						technical courses.
